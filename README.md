# NAP REST
Easily serve a Rest API from your NAP application or perform API calls from your NAP applications. Depends on the single header [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) 

## Use the NAP rest module as a server
Add a RestServer device to your resources. You can create & add RestFunctions to the server that correspond to API calls to the address & port as set in the RestServer.
